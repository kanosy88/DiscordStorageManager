# DiscordStorageManager

> Your Discord Free and Open Source File Manager

Discover an effortless and cost-free way to store your files using DiscordStorageSync.

## Usage

DSM lets you store your files on discord for free.

To achieve this. DSM sends files from your Discord alt-account in a channel of your choice. DSM cuts files heavier than 25 Mb into several pieces, allowing you to store files of unlimited size on Discord and then collect them when you need them.

In the "config.json" file, you can modify the parameters as you wish, but it's advisable not to increase the "\*\_max_worker" to more than their default values, as this may result in loss of data due to Discord's limitations.

My personal upload speed is 1 GB every 80 seconds.
